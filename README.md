The application focuses on HTML5 forms and form validation. It allows a user to log in, sign up, create an event, and check events that have been created.

It's hosted at http://qqttss.github.io/Meet-up-event-planner .

When a user type in input fields, the validation occurs no later than immediately after user focus leaves the input and is obvious.  Storage and accessing of user information and event information are accomplish by using localStorage.

The App is built with Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery and handlebars.
